# Incorrect Use of $inc Operator in MongoDB UpdateOne

This example demonstrates an uncommon error in MongoDB when using the `$inc` operator within an `updateOne` operation.  The error arises from providing a string value to the `$inc` operator, which expects a numeric value to increment a field.

## Bug Description

The `$inc` operator in MongoDB is designed to increment a numeric field by a specified value. Attempting to increment a field using a string value will lead to unexpected results; MongoDB may not throw an error but it will not increment the field as intended.

## Solution

Ensure you provide a numeric value to the `$inc` operator.  If your field is a string representation of a number, convert it to a number before performing the increment operation or modify your data structure to store the values as numbers from the start.
